# SnakeFolio

SnakeFolio is a basic snake game created using Three.js, a powerful 3D graphics library for the web. This project was developed as part of the Web Programming 2 course and started as a simple portfolio page. However, it evolved into an interactive game where you control a snake made of geometric and colorful objects.

## How to Play

- Use your mouse to navigate and interact with the game.
- Scroll in and out with the mouse to control the direction of the snake's head.
- To move the snake in a different direction, hold the right-click and move the mouse.
- Be careful, you might encounter some projects along the way.
